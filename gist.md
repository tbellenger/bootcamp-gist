# Regex Tutorial on Hex code

This tutorial breaks down a regex expression that matches a hex code. It shows the different individual parts of the expression, what they do and how, when combined they are able to match a hex code. 

## Summary

In this gist I will be looking at a hex code regex and how it works. The regex expression to match a hex code  is `/^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/`. Breaking down this expression into parts gives `^` : matches the start of the string, `#` : matches the '#' character, `?(...|...)` : is used as an OR operator, `[a-f0-9]` : defines any valid hex character 'abcdef0123456789' and `{n}` defines the occurances of the character. Some examples of hex codes would be #efefef or #000.

## Regex Components

### Anchors
Anchors are used to match positions before, after or between characters. In the above example of a regex expression to match a hex code anchors are used at the start of the expression `^` to match the start of the string and `$` at the end of the expression which matches to the end of the string.

### Quantifiers
Quantifiers specify how many matches are required in the regular expression. In the above exmaple of a regex expression to matcha a hex code, quantifiers are used to limit the hex code to either 6 or 3 characters using `{6}` following the first character group and `{3}` following the second character group.

### OR Operator
OR Operator specifies a choice between different options in the regular expression. In the above example of a regex express to match a hex code, OR operator is used between the character groups and their quantifiers. The `?` outside of the brackets and the `|` that separates the character groups and quantifiers `?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})` means that either of these character group and quantifiers may be matched. 

### Character Classes
Character classes are used in the above example of a regex expression to match a hex code in order to specify that a hex code is made up of characters 'abcdef' or numerics '0123456789'. The regex character class for 'abcdef' is `[a-f]` and '0123456789' is `[0-9]`. These can be combined in a single class to form `[a-f0-9]`.
